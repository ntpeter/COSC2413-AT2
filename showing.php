			<h2>In the Heart of the Sea (Art/Foreign)</h2>
			<p>
				In 1820, crewmen (Chris Hemsworth, Benjamin Walker, Cillian 
				Murphy) aboard the New England vessel Essex face a harrowing 
				battle for survival when a whale of mammoth size and strength 
				attacks with force, crippling their ship and leaving them 
				adrift in the ocean. Pushed to their limits and facing storms, 
				starvation, panic and despair, the survivors must resort to the 
				unthinkable to stay alive. Their incredible tale ultimately 
				inspires author Herman Melville to write "Moby-Dick."
